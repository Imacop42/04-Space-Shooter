# Bird of Prey
Bird of Prey is a horizontal shooter game, created for my class MSCH-C220, where you control an eagle with laser eyes. Your goal is to shoot the other birds that appear, with each kill giving you points.

Blackbirds are the largest and generally the slowest, and are worth the least ammount of points.

Bluejays are the second largest and of a medium speed, and are worth more points than the Blackbirds.

The white birds are the second smallest and generally swift, and are worth more points than Bluejays.

Cardinals are the smallest and fastest birds, giving the most points in the game.

Running into the birds will kill them, but grant you no points and lower your health. As a rule of thumb, the more points a bird would give you, the more damage it will do to you upon collision.



The soundtrack is the song "Ricochet Love" by Waterflame.
